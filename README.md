# PyPM

## Overview
PyPM is a tool to either program or monitor a power management device from
Linear Technology.
Additionaly it provides a parser to convert a in circuit programming file
into CSV.

## Monitor
The ability to measure and log voltages/currents is an essential helpful tool
for engineers in general. Let's do it with matplotlib

## Interfacing
The variety of interfaces on modern microcontrolleris quite large.
RS232, USB, Ethernet ... just to name a few.
I'm a hardware engineer ... not a software expert. Let's try to provide an
abstraction level for some possible interfaces.
